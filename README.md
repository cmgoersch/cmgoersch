### Hi there 👋

## My name is Calle 🚀

After completing my training at **Neue Fische** Agentur Hamburg, I fully immersed myself in the world of coding and embarked on my exciting journey as a developer. 🖥️

During my time at **Neue Fische**, I developed my capstone project called **better-friend-app**, an app designed to help users engage with their friends in a playful and more balanced manner. Feel free to check it out:

Since October 2024, I'm also attending a **Web Development course** at **DCI (Digital Career Institute)** for one year to deepen my skills in web development. Additionally, over the past few months, I have also been learning **Python** to expand my programming knowledge. 🐍

Prior to diving into coding, I completed a **Graphic Design apprenticeship (2009-2012)** at the **Akademie für Kommunikation in Pforzheim**, and I have **over 10 years of experience** working as a **graphic and web designer**. During this time, I specialized in **UI/UX Design** and gathered extensive knowledge in creating user-centric digital experiences.

Currently, I also channel my creativity as a graphic and screen designer for [**Madways UG**](https://www.madways.de/), an amazing agency nestled in Karlsruhe, Germany. 🎨

- 🌐 HTML | CSS | JavaScript 
- 🛢️ MongoDB | React | Next.js | Python
