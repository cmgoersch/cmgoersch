### Hi there 👋

## My name is Calle 🚀

Having completed my training at **Neue Fische** Agentur Hamburg, I'm now fully immersed in the coding world and embarked on my exhilarating developer journey. 🖥️

During my time at **Neue Fische** Agentur Hamburg, I developed my capstone project called **better-friend-app**. This app is designed to help users engage with their friends in a playful and more balanced manner. Here's a sneak peek:

Aside from that, I channel my creativity as a graphic and screen designer for [**Madways UG**](https://www.madways.de/), an amazing agency nestled in Karlsruhe, Germany. 🎨

**Tech Stack & Interests**:
