### Hey there! 👋  

## I'm Calle – Designer turned Developer 🚀  

After over **10 years in graphic and web design**, specializing in **UI/UX**, I decided to take my passion for digital experiences to the next level – **by becoming a developer**.  

### 🛠️ My Journey  
- Trained at **Neue Fische** (Hamburg), where I built my capstone project **<a href="https://capstone-project-seven-rho.vercel.app/" target="_blank">better-friend-app</a>** – an app that helps users engage with friends in a fun, balanced way.  
- Since **September 2024**, I’ve been sharpening my skills in **Web Development at DCI (Digital Career Institute)**.  
- Recently, I also started exploring **Python** to expand my tech toolkit. 🐍  

### 🎨 + 🖥️ = ❤️  
With a background in **graphic & UI/UX design**, I bring a keen eye for aesthetics and usability to development. Currently, I also work as a **graphic & screen designer at <a href="https://www.madways.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madways UG</a>** in Karlsruhe.
